# WhisperVector: Experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Locally-Hosted ML Models

## Overview

WhisperVector is a Python project that explores the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging locally-hosted machine learning (ML) models.

## Motivation

The idea behind RAG is to use a retrieval-based approach to select relevant information from a large dataset and then generate new text that incorporates this information. By combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation, WhisperVector aims to create more coherent, informative, and engaging text output.
